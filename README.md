## DESCRIPTION

The organ Donation Management System is designed for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities in order to allow donors to register and check the availability of organs for donation. 

Anyone will be able to register as an organ donor on the website. Those who are interested in becoming organ donors will be able to sign up online. The public will also get information on whether or not an organ is available for donation.

An administrator will be in charge of this application and will have access to the database and records pertaining to the donors and organs available for donation. Only the administrator will have access to the organ and donor databases. Because of its simplicity, registering as a donor is more convenient for the user. This web application will be used for much of the registration process.

When an organ transplant is scheduled, doctors or family members of the patient will use this web tool to verify the availability of an organ in the listed hospitals and centres.

The website design consists of 7 pages:
1) The Home Page, 
2) The Admin Login,
3) The Donor Login, 
4) The Donor Account Page, 
5) The Admin Account Page,
6) The Register to be a Donor page
7) Check Kidney Availability page.
